For each question where we ask for bird names, give the birdâ€™s common name, scientific name and species abbreviation.


Which bird had the highest total count?
Which bird had the highest total count above a latitude of -30?
How many different types of birds were only ever seen in groups of 1?
How many penguins were seen? (Hint: there are many types of penguin)


Which bird had the most individual sightings?

```{r}
birds_joined %>% 
  select(species_common_name, species_scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(count()) %>% 
  top_n(1, count)

```
