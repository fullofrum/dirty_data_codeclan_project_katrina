Introduction
The data we were presented with comprised 3 separate excel files containing information gathered over 3 years regarding the habits and sweet preferences of individuals on Halloween.  They contained personal information (eg. age, gender), social habits (going out on Halloween) as well as a substantial list of sweets which were rated according to "JOY", "DESPAIR" and "MEH".

Cleaning
The inital cleaning process involved passing all the datasets through Janitor clean_names to remove capitals and other punctuation from the column heads.


<!-- first_clean_2015 <- clean_names(boing_boing_candy_2015) -->


We had several discussions about our remit as data analysts before we started cleaning the data.  Included in the data sets were information outwith the topic of 'candy' including drinks (eg. kale smoothie and mint julep), drugs (vicodin) and bread products (white bread).  We decided to remove any item which was not a sweet or something that could conceivably be given to Trick or Treaters.  This meant keeping food related items including healthy_fruit and box_o_raisins since some parents like to give Trick or Treaters and option to be more healthy.  The rest of the food columns and columns which seemed irrelevant to the dataset (eg. Real Housewives of Orange County Season 9 Blue-Ray) were removed.


<!-- second_clean_2017 <- first_clean_2017[ -c(1,12,21,22,26,27,31,43,46,48,49,68,69,72,81,92,96,104,105,107,108,112:120) ] -->


Two of the datasets had a timestamp which contained a year - the year data was extracted into a new column called year and in the 2107 data, the "q" prefix to the column headings was removed.

<!-- colnames(second_clean_2017) <- gsub("^.{3}", "", colnames(second_clean_2017)) -->


We used an excel sheet to visualise all the different naming conventions across the 3 datasets and set about standardising them to enable the 3 datasets to be joined successfully.  There were several situtions where there were multiple versions/flavours of the same sweets eg jolly_ranchers_good_flavor and jolly_ranchers_bad_flavor and blue/red/grees/peanut/regular M&Ms.  We decided to keep these as separate entities since some people have a strong preference for a colour or flavour of sweet.  

The exceptions to this was for the sweet Mary Janes .  In the 2015 and 2016 dataset, there was a sweet was labeled as  "anonymous_brown_globs_that_come_in_black_and_orange_wrappers" and another one labelled "mary_janes" however in the 2017 dataset that this was listed as "anonymous_brown_globs_that_come_in_black_and_orange_wrappers_a_k_a_mary_janes".  We renamed the data in 2015 and 2016 to mary_janes and mary_janes2 instead of combining them, but during the analysis carried out a manual check to make sure that combining these two variable wouldn't have changed the outcome of the analysis. 


<!-- third_clean_2017 <- second_clean_2017 %>%  -->
<!--   rename( -->
<!--     mary_janes2 = anonymous_brown_globs_that_come_in_black_and_orange_wrappers_a_k_a_mary_janes, -->
<!--     box_o_raisins = boxo_raisins, -->
<!--     free_restaurant_candy = candy_that_is_clearly_just_the_stuff_given_out_for_free_at_restaurants, -->
<!--     chick_o_sticks = chick_o_sticks_we_don_t_know_what_that_is, -->
<!--     hersheys_milk_chocolate = hershey_s_milk_chocolate, -->
<!--     jolly_ranchers_bad_flavor = jolly_rancher_bad_flavor, -->
<!--     peanut_m_ms = peanut_m_m_s, -->
<!--     reeses_peanut_butter_cups = reese_s_peanut_butter_cups, -->
<!--     boo_berry_crunch = sandwich_sized_bags_filled_with_boo_berry_crunch, -->
<!--     sourpatch_kids = sourpatch_kids_i_e_abominations_of_nature, -->
<!--     odd_marshmallow_peanuts = those_odd_marshmallow_circus_peanut_things, -->
<!--     toblerone = tolberone_something_or_other -->
<!--   ) -->

We noticed that the age column was as a chr so we changed that to an integer then started the mammtoth task of cleaning the county data.  Our approach was as follows:
1. Searched for unique country names within each dataset
2. There were so many variations of capital and lower case letters - we ran the str_to_lower function to make our lives a bit easier!
3. Random responses such as "fear and loathing" and "unhinged states" and were changed to NAs
4. All variations of a single country were inserted into a vector and this was used to change all variations to a consitant naming format
5. The initial letters of countries which were changed to lower case during the str_to_lower step were reverted to uppercase to allow for searching further down the line.

<!--       country ==  "fear and loathing"| -->
<!--       country ==  "unhinged states" ~ NA_character_,  -->
<!--     TRUE ~ country -->
<!--   )) -->

Conclusions
By far the most popular candy bar was any_full_size_candy_bar.  It came out top for both males and females, and over all 3 years data were collected.  It was also the favourite candy for data analysed for UK, USA and Canada individually as well as all the other countries combined.
Reeces products were also very popular.  The peanut butter cups were rated second favourite by both males and females and the peanut candy bar was second favourite in both 2015 and 2017.  This could be because the majority of the data was gathered from North America - 95% of respondants who specified their country came from North America (3429 USA + Canada of 3595)
Respondants rated lollipops top for being MEH and broken glow sticks and gum from basketball cards had the highest DESPAIR rating.
There was very little difference between the average age of people going out and staying in:  35 years vs 39 years.  
When it came to analsying the most popular candy bar for each gender, there were twice as many male respondants to female respondants (1584 vs 875).  This was mirrored within the dataset with 1248 people identifying as female and 2261 as male.  It should be noted that there was only gender data for 2 of the 3 datasets - there was no gender information given for 2015.
Although the ever popular any_full_size_candy_bar rated highly for the UKs favourite sweet, it had the same rating as lindt_truffle, rolos and toblerone.  There were significantly fewer respondants who named their country as UK (61 vs 3085 for USA)
